# Awesome Synthux Community

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

[!Synthux image](community-owl/badge.svg) * todo

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial initiative contributed by the community. Readers are encouraged to comment and contribute.

## Goal / What is this list? / Why is it "awesome"?

**To share anything of interest related to Synthux and the mission of learning, building and programming synthesizers.**

**_Awesome_** lists are a repository, a collection of usefull links about a certain topic. Search GitHub and you'll find pages ranging from [puredata](https://github.com/MikeMorenoDSP/awesome-puredata) to [pen ploters](https://github.com/beardicus/awesome-plotters).

### Synthux by the community for the community - this list is unoffical

In the open‑source world, an awesome list is usually:
- community‑curated
- broad in scope
- opinionated
- not “official documentation”

→ Hosting this inside the Synthux GitHub account might be counterintuitive, but the idea of keeping it here ensures it's easier to find and reach a the whole community without a direct risk of loosing access to the original.

Community members can apply for maintenance roles, or you could simply add links or suggestions via a pull request or making an "issue". (#todo insert direct issue link)

Synthux Academy is part of Stichting PTM Academy - a registered non-profit organization based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. It's founder Roey Tsemah has started the organization and community for anyone looking to learn and connect with fellow synth-nerds. The community ranges from music maker enthousiasts, DIY makers as well as professionals. The common goal is to share our love for music and technology.

Synthux has a few of their own synths, most of which are made available as DIY kits and their source code is open source. There's a very open culture, building on the vast amount of available content in the space of music technology.

While most Synthux kits come with the Electrosmith Daisy Seed microcontroller, the Simple PCB’s do fit other microcontrollers as well.

## Community submitted code and hardware mods for Synthux instruments

Synthux instruments are genuinely fun to hack on. Simple Touch and Audrey II have gotten new looks, extra jacks, and all kinds of personal touches. Simple Fix is a popular first step before people go off and build something entirely their own. Everyone brings their own tools, parts, and ideas — and that's kind of the point.

### General — applicable to all Simple / Daisy

### Simple Designer

A few of the Synthux and community made instruments are made on top of the Designer PCB, Audrey is probably the most spread and officially sold in the Synthux shop. Therefore Audrey has it’s own section.

[Simple Canvas](https://github.com/Synthux-Academy/simple-designer-instruments/tree/main/official/canvas) - The Canvas is a cordless patchable West Cost Synthesizer. This synthesizer is born from a collaboration with the Synthux Academy. Its design is inspired by the famous Easel by Buchla. design in coöperation with community member Helixbyte

#### Audrey (II)

Audrey was first shared / made as a diy project on top of the Simple Designer PCB board. Later Synthux started selling the updated kit and standalone unit.

The code of version one and two is the same, the main difference is that V2 has a dedicated enclosure and front plate option.

#### Audrey hardware mods

## Documentation / guides (Electrosmith Daisy)

Synthux instruments are mostly made with **Daisy**, though other boards can fit the Simple PCB's. Therefore some info or guides may be in full about Synthux, some partly.

Note Synthux also has paid-for courses (and/or included with bying kits). Do check out the official website for more info. Here we're trying to link to freely available info.

Daisy can be programmed with **Arduino**, **CPP** and **Plugdata** (puredata), **Max** (oopsy)

Some guides will have info about hardware and adding circuits, where possible mention this.

### Arduino - DaisyDuino

DaisyDuino is very similar to the library for C++, libDaisy, though there are differences, and are not interchangeable.

Note that it is also possible to use e.g. VSCode to program Arduino’s - though following the most tutorials you’ll use the dedicated Arduino IDE. Follow the guidelines to setup your environment as you’ll need to 1: install the **STM32CubeProg**, and 2: install the official DaisyDuino library from within the IDE.

[arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc) - main website

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#ide) - download the official Arduino software

[Arduino setup instructions from Electrosmith](https://daisy.audio/tutorials/arduino-dev-env) - Note that uploading / compiling and flashing with Arduino to Daisy will require the additional steps laid out in this guide

[Zadig Driver](https://www.notion.so/PD-Daisy-docs-meeting-notes-17a26099464b80b5ac96e25f4994e508?pvs=21) - Reset instructions (Windows Only)

[Synthux Simple Fix](https://github.com/Synthux-Academy/simple-fix-instruments) - DaisyDuino Arduino based instruments

[Synthux Simple Touch DaisyDuino](https://github.com/Synthux-Academy/simple-touch-instruments/tree/main/daisyduino) - note that the parent folder also contains cpp libDaisy code

- All the Simple Touch 2 instruments are made with Arduino code split into handy blocks. - you will also find the `.bin` versions you could upload with the webprogrammer.

### Plugdata

Plugdata is a visual programmer based on PureData; though patches made with this method cannot be uploaded as is, HVCC is integrated into Plugdata; it converts pd to compiled code that can be uploaded to Daisy (as well as other formats from full plugins to game related code). HVCC is the Heavy compiler maintained by one of the members who have joined the community: dreamer, aka Wasted Audio.
